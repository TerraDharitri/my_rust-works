This repository contains a wide variety of tools, aimed primarily at smart contract developers.

The repo contains:
- The most complete smart contract framework on Dharitri:
    - The base framework;
    - A complete build system, which relies on the smart contract code directly;
    - A powerful debugger, based on a partial implementation of the Dharitri VM, in Rust.
    - A framework for writing both black-box and white-box tests. They rely on the standard Dharitri blockchain scenario format.
    - The official data serializer and deserializer for smart contract data. Can be used both on- and off-chain.
- A large collection of smart contract examples and feature tests, together with some of the core smart contracts used on the blockchain (e.g. the wrapped rewa swap, multisig, etc.).
- A framework for interacting with the blockchain, based on the smart contract logic, especially suitable for developers.
- A code snippet generator.
